2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-138#1 Warning
SLICE_PairEqSame_D6D5_WARN  
Luts D6LUT and D5LUT in use in site SLICE_X3Y9 with different equations without A6 pin connected to Global Logic High.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-138#2 Warning
SLICE_PairEqSame_D6D5_WARN  
Luts D6LUT and D5LUT in use in site SLICE_X9Y9 with different equations without A6 pin connected to Global Logic High.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-23#1 Warning
enum_AREG_1_connects_CEA2_connects_CEA2_GND  
RISCV_core_inst/alu_dsp_enabled.ALU_inst/DSP48E1_inst: When the DSP48E1 AREG attribute is set to 1, the CEA2 input pin should be active or tied to VCC if the A&B bus is selected as an X MUX input, i.e. OPMODE0 and OPMODE1 are 1. Otherwise if CEA2 is GND, then the A segment of the A&B bus will always be zero.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-27#1 Warning
enum_BREG_1_connects_CEB2_connects_CEB2_GND  
RISCV_core_inst/alu_dsp_enabled.ALU_inst/DSP48E1_inst: When the DSP48E1 BREG attribute is set to 1, the CEB2 input pin should be active or tied to VCC if the A&B bus is selected as an X MUX input, i.e. OPMODE0 and OPMODE1 are 1. Otherwise if CEB2 is GND, then the B segment of the A&B bus will always be zero.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-4#1 Advisory
enum_USE_DPORT_FALSE_enum_DREG_ADREG_0_connects_CED_CEAD_RSTD_GND  
RISCV_core_inst/alu_dsp_enabled.ALU_inst/DSP48E1_inst: DSP48E1 is not using the D port (USE_DPORT = FALSE). For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0'.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-165#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (RISCV_core_inst/register_file_vec_inst/regfile_bot_inst/MEM_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.

REQP-165#2 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (RISCV_core_inst/register_file_vec_inst/regfile_top_inst/MEM_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation.
